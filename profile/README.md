## 🧠 What Makes Fake PhonePe Stand Out?

Fake PhonePe isn't just a game — it’s a **satirical mirror** of modern-day digital finance.

- **Unique concept**: One-of-a-kind simulation based on real-world payment behavior

## 🎨 Graphics and Sound – A Visual Revolution

The visual style of Fake PhonePe is a blend of:
- **Cartoonish UI parodies** of real apps (PhonePe, GPay, etc.)
- Glitch effects and retro-futuristic overlays
- NPCs with exaggerated reactions and expressive animations

**Soundtrack**: Funky synth-pop with occasional meme SFX. Each action — from "successful scams" to "caught by police" — is paired with over-the-top sound cues that make the experience even more ridiculous.
